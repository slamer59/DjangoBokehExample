        <p>Happiness is a small web application that lets users in a company log in and record
            their happiness.</p>

        <p>Users are part of teams. On their dashboard they can see a plot of their happiness over time
            and their team's average happiness. If users are in more than one team they will see average
            happiness for all their teams.</p>

        <p>Managers can manage one or more teams. Their dashboard shows the average happiness for all the teams
            they manage as well as individual lines for all the team members.</p>
